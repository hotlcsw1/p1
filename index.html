<h2>In 2 sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
<p>I am Arcot Prakash and I live in Washington, DC.  I am a former entrepreneur, now a full time graduate student.  I like managing engineering Teams and developing commercial software products.  I look forward to returning to these ventures or being part of a VC firm after I complete my graduate program.</p>

<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
<p>I am taking this course to expand my technology knowledge especially with web development.  In particular, I want to learn how to write server side scripts using PHP.  I want to garner additional skills in this space to collaborate with engineers who build enterprise web products using these toolsets.  I also have a curious mind, and would like to keep my skills sharp.</p>

<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
<p>I have previous experience working with C, Java, Pl/SQL, HTML and JavaScript.  I have written enterprise applications for various industries including financial, insurance, government, healthcare and manufacturing.  I really enjoy web development, though rarely am I able to find the time to do so.  So, I am looking forward to doing web development in this class.</p>

<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC or some other platform?</h2>
<p>I have both a PC and a Mac, though I am much more comfortable working with PC.  I am in the process of shifting to a Mac entirely as I find the platform and the toolsets ever expanding for enterprise class application development and deployments.</p>

<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
<p>I enjoy hiking, swimming and reading technology and financial news.  I love to travel and have committed myself to visiting a new country every 2 years.  In 2013 I was fortunate to be able to travel to India and Brazil.  I have two beautiful dogs named Jake and Blake (see picture above of this guy), and I love spending time with my family.</p>
